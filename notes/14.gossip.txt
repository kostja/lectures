Expressing these ideas in more technical terms, a gossip protocol is one that satisfies the following conditions:

    The core of the protocol involves periodic, pairwise, inter-process
    interactions.
    The information exchanged during these interactions is of bounded size.
    When agents interact, the state of at least one agent changes to reflect
    the state of the other.
    Reliable communication is not assumed.
    The frequency of the interactions is low compared to typical message
    latencies so that the protocol costs are negligible.
    There is some form of randomness in the peer selection. Peers might be
    selected from the full set of nodes or from a smaller set of neighbors.
